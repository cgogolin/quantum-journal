# LaTeX document class for Quantum

`quantumarticle` is the document class for typsetting articles in Quantum.

## Installation and usage

To use the `quantumarticle` document class with LaTeX simply start your document with the line:

```latex
\documentclass[your options]{quantumarticle}

```
Before you can do this however, you must install `quantumarticle.cls`. You have several options for doing this:

1. The `quantumarticle` class is provided with install scripts for bash and PowerShell. These scripts should work for Windows 7 or later with MiKTeX, or for TeX Live with Linux or macOS / OS X. To install the class into your user-local LaTeX directory from within bash:
 ```bash
 $ cd quantum-journal/
 $ ./install.sh
 ```
 Similarly, under PowerShell:
 ```powershell
 PS > cd quantum-journal/
 PS > ./install.ps1
 ```

2. To manually install `quantumarticle`, copy `quantumarticle.cls` to `texmf/tex/latex/quantumarticle` within your home directory (under Linux, macOS, and OS X `~/`, or under Windows typically `C:\Users\[your username]`) and run `texhash` (TeX Live) or `initexmf --update-fndb` (MiKTeX).

3. Alternatively you can use `quantumarticle.cls` without installing it by simply putting it in the same folder as your main LaTeX source file. This can be the most convenient option if you are working on a manuscript together with collaborators that do not want to install `quantumarticle.cls` and are exchanging the source files of your manuscript via email or cloud storage services. When you upload your manuscript to the arXiv you will anyway have to include `quantumarticle.cls` along with other source files.

4. Finally, you can use `quantumarticle.cls` without even downloading it at all on the collaborative writing platform [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) by starting your project from the `quantumarticle` [template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submission-to-quantum-journal/gsjgyhxrtrzy) as well as with the [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/project) online LaTeX editor by using the `quantumarticle` [template](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/5851932b93a02abc513710f3) there.

## Dependencies

`quantumarticle.cls` should work with any reasonably recent LaTeX distribution. It further requires the following packages: `xkeyval`, `etoolbox`, `geometry`, `xcolor`, `fancyhdr`, `tikz`, `hyperref`, ltxgrid and ltxcmds (often distributed along with revtex, in texlive for example as part of `texlive-publishers`), as well as at least either `lmodern` or `type1ec`. We recommend to have `natbib` and at least one of `bbm` or `dsfont` installed. All of these should be included in the full install variant of your LaTeX distribution (for example `texlive-full`).

## Compatibility

The `quantumarticle` class tries to be **maximally compatible** with existing document classes, such as, `article`, `revtex`, `iopart`, and `elsarticle`. It supports all standard options, like `twocolumn`, `onecolumn`, `titlepage`, as well as the standard syntax for defining the title page with the `\author`, `\address`, and `\affiliation` commands and the `abstract` environment.
